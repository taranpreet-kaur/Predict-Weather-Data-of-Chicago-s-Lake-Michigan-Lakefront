# Predict-Weather-Data-of-Chicago-s-Lake-Michigan-Lakefront
The aim of this study is to do the comparison of weather forecasting by using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model. VAR(multivariate) model is used to forecast one of the outcome variables using the other predictor variables. The model with the outcome variable “Air Temperature” is used as a baseline to compare LSTM and GRU models at the later stage . Further,this project proposes GRU and LSTM models for forecasting outcome variable “Air Temperature” at the three beaches using other predictor variable such as Wet Bulb Temperature, Barometric Pressure, rain and humidity. This study compares the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) resulted by VAR model with the MAE(by training and validation loss) resulted by LSTM and GRU model. The results of this experiment show that GRU model with bi-directional layers has better performance than other models but in our evaluation on real-world data, LSTM achieved significant performance improvements over other methods described in the project.
